Use this component to integrate Digo Speaker Monitor into ESPHome / Home Assistant ecosystem.

Before using this components make sure:

- board is configured to ``nodemcu-32s``
- :ref:`UART bus <uart>` is configured with default RX / TX pins and 115200 baud rate
- :doc:`logger </components/logger>` to the serial port is disabled by setting ``baud_rate`` to ``0``

This component is useless for devices other than Sonoff D1 dimmer.

Configuration variables:
------------------------

- **id** (*Optional*, :ref:`config-id`): Manually specify the ID used for code generation.
- **name** (**Required**, string): The name of the light.
- **use_rm433_remote** (*Optional*, boolean): Set to ``True`` if your setup uses Sonoff RM433
  or any other radio remote control. Properly setting this parameter allows the platform to
  identify what to do with incoming UART commands. RF chip is known to catch random commands
  if not paired with a real remote (so called ghost commands). This problem is observed even
  with the stock firmware and most probably is a bug in the MCU firmware or in the RF chip
  firmware. Setting this to ``False`` instructs the platform to properly ignore such commands
  and thus prevent unexpected switches or light intensity changes.
- **min_value** (*Optional*, int): The lowest dimmer value allowed. Acceptable value for your
  setup will depend on actual light bulbs installed and number of them. Start with the default
  value and check what will be the minimal brightness bulbs can render. Pay attention that for
  some dimmable LED lamps minimal turn-on brightness will be higher that the minimal achievable
  brightness if you just decrease it when lamp is already turned on. Defaults to 0.
- **max_value** (*Optional*, int): The highest dimmer value allowed. Use this to hard-limit light
  intensity for your setup. For some bulbs this parameter might be also useful to prevent
  flickering at high brightness values. Defaults to 100.
- All other options from :ref:`Light <config-light>`.
